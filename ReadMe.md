# Canvas

Fun project to challenge myself on React and more globally in JS.

## Installation

To launch the project, just use [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).  
When containers are launched, the React page is displayed in the port `80` and the WebSocket is in the port `3000`.

## Architecture of the project

`client` : folder for the front. It is a React project.  
`server` : folder for the server. This is a simple JS file.
